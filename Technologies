  This video explains the difference between Statically Typed and Dynamically Typed Languages. In Statically Typed Languages the variable is already known at compile time.
  This means that you, as a programmer, must what type each variable is. The advantage to the Statically Typed Languages is that the cheking is done by the compiler, which,
  means a lot of bugs are caught early on. Some popular Statically Typed Languages are Java, C, C++. Dynamically Typed Languages are the ones where the run-time values are
  not named variables/fields/etc. Some popular Dynamically Typed Languages are Ruby, Python or JavaScript.
