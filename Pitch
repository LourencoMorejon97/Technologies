Hello, my name is Lourenço, I’m a young aspiring UX/UI Designer. I have a Bachelor's in Design and a Master’s Degree in UX/UI Design. I also enrolled in a Web
Development bootcamp at the Wild Code School to improve my coding knowledge and proficiency. I believe that my newly acquired coding knowledge will be very useful
when combined with my Design background. I also have some working experience in the sales and customer service areas, that I believe could add a lot of value to my
application in the form of soft skills. These jobs mostly required me to understand the needs of the clients and help and guide said clients in the search for certain
items/products that would fit their needs. Overall I believe my experience and my formal education would allow me to bring value to many companies.
